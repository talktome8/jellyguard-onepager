    "text": "Every year, massive jellyfish blooms force emergency shutdowns at power stations, desalination plants, and cooling systems worldwide. Each shutdown costs $400K-$900K in lost production, emergency response, and damage control. Traditional solutions — chemical treatments, mechanical screens, manual removal — are expensive, environmentally harmful, and only 60-75% effective. Your operations deserve better."

      {
        "question": "What intake sizes can JellyGuard protect?",
        "answer": "JellyGuard scales from 0.5m to 15m diameter intakes. Systems are modular and can protect flow rates from 5,000 m³/hr to 500,000 m³/hr. For larger facilities, multiple units work in parallel."
      },
      {
        "question": "What power requirements does the system need?",
        "answer": "Minimal. Standard systems draw 2-8 kW depending on size - 95% less than mechanical screening alternatives. Solar-compatible for remote installations."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does it work in all water conditions?",
        "answer": "Yes. Tested in temperatures 4°C-32°C, salinity 10-40 PSU, and flow velocities 0.3-2.5 m/s. Handles mixed species blooms (jellyfish, salps, ctenophores)."
      },
      {
        "question": "What materials are used?",
        "answer": "Marine-grade aluminum frames, HDPE panels, stainless steel fasteners. All non-toxic, corrosion-resistant, designed for 15+ year lifespan in harsh marine environments."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is it different from physical screens?",
        "answer": "Screens trap and kill organisms, require constant cleaning, and create intake blockages. JellyGuard guides organisms away using natural behavior - no contact, no damage, no clogging."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does installation take?",
        "answer": "Site assessment: 2-3 days. System design: 2-4 weeks. Installation: 5-12 days depending on size. Full commissioning and training: 2 days. Most facilities operational within 8 weeks."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can it be installed without shutting down operations?",
        "answer": "Yes. Modular design allows phased installation during normal maintenance windows. No full shutdown required for most configurations."
      },
      {
        "question": "What certifications do installers need?",
        "answer": "Our certified team handles installation. Local dive team support may be required. We provide full training for your maintenance staff post-installation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is retrofitting existing intakes possible?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. 85% of installations are retrofits. Works with any intake type: vertical wells, horizontal pipes, culverts, cooling channels. Custom design for each site."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the typical ROI timeline?",
        "answer": "18-36 months depending on facility size and current downtime costs. Mediterranean desalination plant achieved ROI in 14 months through eliminated emergency cleanings."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the total cost of ownership vs. alternatives?",
        "answer": "5-year TCO is 60% lower than mechanical screening, 75% lower than chemical treatment. No consumables, minimal energy costs, 2-3 service visits per year."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there leasing or financing options?",
        "answer": "Yes. Full purchase, 3/5-year leases, or performance-based contracts (pay per uptime hour). Flexible terms for municipal and private operators."
      },
      {
        "question": "What ongoing costs should we expect?",
        "answer": "Annual maintenance: $12K-$45K depending on size. Includes 2-3 service visits, remote monitoring, parts replacement. Energy costs: $2K-$8K/year."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the system efficacy rate?",
        "answer": "95-98% bloom prevention in field deployments. Independent validation by marine research institutes. Maintains 90%+ efficacy during extreme bloom events (>100 organisms/m³)."
      },
      {
        "question": "How quickly does it respond to bloom arrivals?",
        "answer": "Instant. Passive system is always active. Integrated sensors detect blooms 6-12 hours before intake arrival, allowing operational adjustments."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens during maintenance periods?",
        "answer": "System remains operational during routine checks. Critical maintenance scheduled during low-bloom seasons. Redundant modules allow partial system maintenance without shutdown."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is there a performance guarantee?",
        "answer": "Yes. We guarantee 90% reduction in jellyfish-related downtime or full refund within first year. Performance bond available for large installations."
